# ARena 🪐

*A Flutter application using the new ARCore* 

## 🎯 Motto 

This application offers a platform of Augmented Reality to visualize geographical elements.

## 🔺 Scale

Although the current 3D models are statically included as a list for display, it can further be done by integrating cloud storage combined with a database, similar to the rest of the app's functions to make it entirely dynamic.
